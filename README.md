You can now use your GPT API key to customize your favorite NPC or character with Kevacoin. 

1.Create a key with PROMPT that describe the character in your namespace.

2.Open https://npc.to/ (which offers GPT-4 capabilities) or https://npc.to/35 (which offers GPT-3.5 capabilities), and input your GPT key.

3.Rename any images or videos with your Keva namespace number (e.g. 62108412.png).

4.Upload the renamed images or videos to Npc.to

The platform will use your space number and prompts to generate a response from your character.

To generate good prompts, you can use ChatGPT, for example: "I want you to act like {Character} from {Series}. I want you to respond and answer like {Character}, without any explanations. You must know everything about {Character}. My first sentence is 'Hello.'"

Finally, if you have AR glasses, you can enjoy an immersive experience by watching videos or images with a black background and seeing your transparent NPCs fixed in space.
